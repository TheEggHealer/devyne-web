### About the app

Wish Together makes the hassle of organizing gift shopping for events and birthdays a lot easier. Create wishlists, invite your friends and family and start wishing!

In the wishlists, the invited users can the items they're planning on buying. These claims are not visible to the wishes. This makes it easier to see who buys what and reduces the chances of two people buying the same gifts.

By tapping on an item in the list, the users can chat with the wisher and ask for specific details about the item. The users also have the alternative to use a chat that's hidden from the wisher, where they can discuss who buys the item or if they want to split the cost for example.

Group wishlists make it easier to plan events where multiple people are buying gifts for each other. It groups together everyone's wishlists into a single page where they can be easily viewed and managed. Perfect for christmas when many people buy gifts for eachother!

The is only public on [google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonathan.wishtogether) for now, it will be released for ios soon.

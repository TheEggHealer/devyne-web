### About the app

A jogging app that tracks the user when they run. It generates statistics such as calories burned and running speed. The app features a route planner in which you can set waypoints on a map and it generates a route between them and gives you the total distance. You can set goals for yourself and track them easily from the home screen. **The app was never released publicly.**

### About the app

_Split the bill between friends, family, roomates and more!_

Tired of having to calculate how much everybody owes you? Then this app is perfect for you! Just tell the app what was bought and who paid and let the app figure out the rest. You will be presented with the payments that have to be made to settle all debts and have the option to share that with the group of people involved.

The app is available for download on [Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.devyne.split_the_bill). It will be available on iOS app store soon.
